# Hotel Booking Cancellations Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)

## Project Objective  
This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify patterns and key insights behind booking cancellations. The objective is to help hotel management understand guest behaviors, cancellation trends, and factors contributing to cancellations, allowing for better forecasting and policy formulation.

---

## Dataset Used  
**Hotel Booking Data (Excel format)**  
Includes reservation details like guest type, hotel type, arrival year, booking status, and more.

---

## Key Questions (KPIs) Analyzed  
- What is the total number of reservations and cancellations?  
- What types of guests cancel most often?  
- How do cancellations vary between city hotels and resort hotels?  
- Which months see the highest and lowest cancellations?  
- What is the difference in cancellations between weekday and weekend nights?  
- Do repeated guests cancel less often than first-time guests?  
- Are cancellations more frequent for desired or undesired bookings?

---

## Process  
- Cleaned and validated raw booking data to ensure consistency  
- Created pivot tables to calculate totals and segment cancellations  
- Designed a dynamic, interactive Excel dashboard with slicers (year-wise filters)  
- Used charts and visuals to represent trends by guest type, hotel type, time of year, and booking nature  
- Applied color coding and donut/bar charts to highlight comparisons clearly

- **Repeated vs Non-Repeated Guests:** 99% cancellations by new guests  
- **Desired vs Undesired Bookings:** Most cancellations are for desired bookings

---

## Project Insights  
- Couples cancel bookings more frequently than other guest types  
- Resort hotels face a significantly higher cancellation rate compared to city hotels  
- Peak cancellation months are mid-year (July to August), aligning with high-demand seasons  
- Non-repeated guests are far more likely to cancel than returning ones  
- Weeknight bookings show a disproportionately high cancellation rate  
- Most cancellations happen on desired bookings, indicating issues like price changes or overbooking

---

## Final Conclusion  
To reduce cancellations, hotels should implement flexible pricing strategies during peak months and focus on building loyalty programs for new customers. Attention should also be given to understanding why resort hotels experience more cancellations and why guests cancel weekday stays. Better targeting of repeat guests and personalized offers can help improve retention and reduce booking volatility.
